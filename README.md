# C-Text

I am currently writing this in my text editor!

# TODO

- Tabs (like windows not \t)
- ICONS, ICONS, ICONS!
- *** Watch a video on IPC handlers and main / preload processes
  - I understand now
- *** Is it actually giving me the correct folder structure and information?
- Loading icon
  - Especially when loading a workspace
- Settings:
  - Themes
  - Tab spacing
- Reflect changes made in other editors (constantly refresh file content on machine?)
- LSP 
- Right click functionality in the browser
- Git integration (expert level difficulty) 
- Code folding
  - Like the arrows next to functions that minimize that part of the text
- Markdown preview
- HTML page renderer
- Drag and drop support
  - Drag a file into another folder
  - Drag something from external apps and put it into the editor's browser
- Terminal integration
