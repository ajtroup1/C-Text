# C-Text

I am currently writing this in my text editor!

# TODO

- Tabs scrolling horizontal not working
  - Overflow-x disables tabs?
- Loading icon
  - Especially when loading a workspace
- Shortcuts:
  - CTRL+W to close tab
  - CTRL+S (for formatting)
- Disable lsp and autocomplete on certain file types like md
- Reflect changes made in other editors (constantly refresh file content on machine?)
- LSP 
- Right click functionality in the browser
- Git integration (expert level difficulty) 
- Markdown preview
- HTML page renderer
- Drag and drop support
  - Drag a file into another folder
  - Drag something from external apps and put it into the editor's browser
- Takes a while to load in a workspace
- Improve light mode (C-Text not Monaco Editor)
